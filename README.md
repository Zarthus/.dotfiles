|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| clean    | start with clean slate                                     |
| validate | ensure state is desired, and recommend optional deps       |

## extras

Extra fluff that may not be needed on all systems lives in `extra/`

## devtools

- `bin/generate_zsh_replacements` ensures the zshrc will always be up to date.
